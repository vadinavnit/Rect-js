To avoid winding up with a large bundle, it’s good to get ahead of the problem and start “splitting” your bundle. Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack, Rollup and Browserify (via factor-bundle) which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.


Before:

import { add } from './math';

console.log(add(16, 26));
After:

import("./math").then(math => {
  console.log(math.add(16, 26));
});
